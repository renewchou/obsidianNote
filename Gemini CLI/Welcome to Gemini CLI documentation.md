Gemini CLI brings the capabilities of Gemini models to your terminal in an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) environment. 
Gemini CLI consists of a client-side application (`packages/cli`) that communicates with a local server (`packages/core`), which in turn manages requests to the Gemini API and its AI models. 
Gemini CLI also contains a variety of tools for tasks such as performing file system operations, running shells, and web fetching, which are managed by `packages/core`.
